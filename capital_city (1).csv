Afghanistan,Kabul,AFG,Asia,"Kabul, Persian Kābol, city, capital of the province of Kabul and of Afghanistan. The largest urban centre in the country and also its political and economic hub, the city forms one of several districts of Kabul province. It lies at the intersection of roads that lead to Uzbekistan (via Mazār-e Sharīf) to the north, Pakistan (via Jalālābād) to the east, and Kandahār to the south. A settlement has existed at or near Kabul for some 3,500 years, but it was not until the early 20th century that the city extended north of the Kabul River. This growth continued through the 1980s, when villagers from areas affected by the Afghan War (1978–92) migrated to the relative safety of Kabul. Fighting between factions who occupied the city in 1992 resulted in significant damage and displacement of the urban population. The city has witnessed unprecedented growth since the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks."
Albania,Tirana,ALB,Europe,"Tirana, Albanian Tiranë, city, capital of Albania. It lies 17 miles (27 km) east of the Adriatic Sea coast and along the Ishm River, at the end of a fertile plain. It was founded in the early 17th century by a Turkish general, Barkinzade Süleyman Paşa, who is said to have built a mosque, a bathhouse, and a bakery in order to attract settlement. The town gradually became a trading centre at a junction of roads and caravan trails. It was chosen to be the capital of Albania in 1920 by a congress at Lushnjë. Under King Zog I (reigned 1928–39), Italian architects were employed to replan the city. The focus is Skanderbeg Square, whose Etehem Bey Mosque (1819) is now flanked by the Soviet-built Palace of Culture. Nearby is the University of Tirana (1957). The old city stretches to the east and north of the main square and features alehouses and historic architecture. Tirana has museums, a national institute of folklore, a national theatre, and a concert hall. Skanderbeg Square has a large statue of Skanderbeg (Gjergj Kastrioti), the Albanian national hero. The inhabitants of Tirana are mostly Muslim."
Algeria,Algiers,DZA,Africa,"Algiers, French Alger, Arabic Al-Jazāʾir, capital and chief seaport of Algeria. It is the political, economic, and cultural centre of the country.Algiers is built on the slopes of the Sahel Hills, which parallel the Mediterranean Sea coast, and it extends for some 10 miles (16 km) along the Bay of Algiers. The city faces east and north and forms a large amphitheatre of dazzling white buildings that dominate the harbour and the bay. The city takes its name (Arabic: “The Islands”) from several small islands that formerly existed in the bay, all but one of which have been connected to the shore or obliterated by harbour works."
Andorra,Andorra la Vella,AND,Europe,"Andorra la Vella, (Catalan: “Andorra the Old”) , French Andorre la Vieille, Spanish Andorra la Vieja, town, capital of the independent coprincipality of Andorra. It lies near the confluence of the Valira and the Valira del Norte rivers in the narrow Gran Valira valley, on the southern slopes of the Pyrenees. Andorra la Vella long remained relatively isolated from the outside world. Its modernization began in the 1930s with the construction of carriage roads, and its population increased after World War II as a result of the growth of the tourist industry. In the 1960s and ’70s Andorra la Vella was transformed from a rustic town into a busy commercial centre catering to shoppers and tourists. Winter sports areas are nearby. Because of Andorra’s duty-free status, the town is now primarily a retail shopping centre for goods imported from elsewhere in Europe and from Asia. The General Council (Andorra’s parliament) meets in Andorra la Vella. The town is connected by road to the Spanish and French frontiers and shares in both cultures. "
Angola,Luanda,AGO,Africa,"Luanda, also spelled Loanda, formerly São Paulo de Luanda, city, capital of Angola. Located on the Atlantic coast of northern Angola, it is the country’s largest city and one of its busiest seaports. Founded in 1576 by Paulo Dias de Novais and initially settled by the Portuguese, Luanda became the administrative centre of the Portuguese colony of Angola in 1627 and was a major outlet for slave traffic to Brazil. The city is regarded as the capital of the Mbundu peoples, who have their roots in the surrounding area. Luanda has a warm equable climate. The surrounding region fronts a tropical coastal plain that gives way to a tableland dissected and drained by the Cuanza River and other coastal streams. Cambambe Dam, 110 miles (177 km) to the southeast on the Cuanza, supplies power to Luanda. Skyscrapers and wide avenues give Luanda a modern appearance. The higher part of the city, consisting of the outlying districts, is generally poverty-ridden, and the lower is commercial and industrial. The city is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese and is home to Agostinho Neto University (1963) and the Catholic University of Angola (1997). The National Library of Angola and the National Historic Archive are also located there, as are several museums."
Armenia,Yerevan,ARM,Asia,"Yerevan, also spelled Erevan, Erivan, or Jerevan, capital of Armenia. It is situated on the Hrazdan River, 14 miles (23 km) from the Turkish frontier. Though first historically recorded in 607 ce, Yerevan dates by archaeological evidence to a settlement on the site in the 6th–3rd millennia bce and subsequently to the fortress of Yerbuni in 783 bce. From the 6th century bce it formed part of the Armenian kingdom. The city developed as an important focus of trade and has had a long history of siege and storm. At different times it came under the Romans (a ruined fortress remains), Parthians, Arabs, Mongols, Turks, Persians, Georgians, and Russians. In 1582 it fell to the Turks, in 1604 to the Persians, and finally in 1827 to the Russians. In 1920 Yerevan became the capital of the independent Armenian republic. It remained the capital during the periods of Soviet rule and of renewed independence."
Austria,Vienna,AUT,Europe,"Vienna lies in the northeastern corner of Austria, between the foothills of the Alps and the Carpathians, where the Danube (German: Donau), Europe’s second longest river, has cut its course through the mountains. The city is situated alongside the river, most of it on the right bank. "
Azerbaijan,Baku,AZE,Asia,"Baku, Azerbaijani Bakı, city, capital of Azerbaijan. It lies on the western shore of the Caspian Sea and the southern side of the Abşeron Peninsula, around the wide curving sweep of the Bay of Baku. The bay, sheltered by the islands of the Baku Archipelago, provides the best harbour of the Caspian, while the Abşeron Peninsula gives protection from violent northerly winds. The name Baku is possibly a contraction of the Persian bad kube (“blown upon by mountain winds”). Baku derives its importance from its oil industry and its administrative functions. The first historical reference to Baku dates from 885 ce, although archaeological evidence indicates a settlement there several centuries before Christ. By the 11th century ce, Baku was in the possession of the Shīrvān-Shāhs, who made it their capital in the 12th century, although for a period in the 13th and 14th centuries it came under the sway of the Mongols. In 1723 Peter I (the Great) captured Baku, but it was returned to Persia in 1735; Russia captured it finally in 1806. In 1920 Baku became capital of the Azerbaijan republic."
Bahrain,Manama,BHR,Asia,"Manama, Arabic Al-Manāmah, capital and largest city of Bahrain. It lies at the northeast tip of Bahrain island, in the Persian Gulf. About one-fifth of the country’s population lives in the city. First mentioned in Islamic chronicles about 1345 ce, it was taken by the Portuguese (1521) and by the Persians (1602). It has been held, with brief interruptions, by the ruling Āl Khalīfah dynasty since 1783. Because Bahrain concluded a series of treaties (1861–1914) placing the country under increasing British protection, there was a British political agent stationed at Manama from 1900, subject to the political resident for the Persian Gulf, whose headquarters were long at Būshehr, Iran. In 1946 the residency was moved to Manama, where it remained until the city became the capital of independent Bahrain in 1971. Long an important commercial centre of the northern Persian Gulf, Manama had a traditional economy based on pearling, fishing, boatbuilding, and the import trade. Harbour facilities were poor, and ocean vessels had to anchor in the open roadstead 2–4 miles (3–6 km) offshore. The discovery of petroleum on Bahrain in 1932 revolutionized the city’s economy and appearance, with the construction of many modern buildings. Manama developed as a trade, financial, and commercial centre; it is the seat of numerous banks. The headquarters of the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO), however, are at ʿAwālī, in the centre of Bahrain island. Manama was declared a free port in 1958, and the deepwater port facilities of Mīnāʾ Salmān, in the protected bay of Al-Qulayʿah Inlet, southeast of the built-up area of the city, were opened in 1962. With storage and refrigeration facilities and equipment for docking and repair of large oceangoing vessels, it is now one of the most important ports of the Persian Gulf. The island and town of Al-Muḥarraq, Bahrain’s second largest community, lies just northeast; the two cities are linked by a causeway 1.5 miles (2.5 km) long."
Belarus,Minsk,BLR,Europe,"Minsk, city, capital of Belarus, and administrative centre of Minsk oblast (region). The city lies along the Svisloch River. First mentioned in 1067, it became the seat of a principality in 1101. Minsk passed to Lithuania in the 14th century and later to Poland and was regained by Russia in the Second Partition of Poland, in 1793. The city has suffered many disasters, including frequent destruction by fire, sacking by the Crimean Tatars in 1505, occupation and damage by French troops in 1812, German occupation in 1918, Polish occupation in 1919–20, and almost total destruction in World War II, especially during the Soviet advance in 1944. Nevertheless, Minsk steadily increased in importance, first as a provincial centre after 1793 and later as an industrial centre after the building of the Moscow-Warsaw and Liepaja-Romny railways through Minsk in the 1870s. In 1919 it became the capital of the Belorussian republic."
Belgium,Brussels,BEL,Europe,"Brussels, Flemish Brussel, French Bruxelles, city, capital of Belgium. It is located in the valley of the Senne (Flemish: Zenne) River, a small tributary of the Schelde (French: Escaut). Greater Brussels is the country’s largest urban agglomeration. It consists of 19 communes, or municipalities, each with a large measure of administrative autonomy. The largest commune—which, like the greater metropolitan area, is named Brussels—contains the historic core of the city and the so-called “European Quarter,” where the institutions of the European Union (EU) are located. Greater Brussels officially became the Brussels-Capital Region in 1989, during the federalization of Belgium. Along with the much larger regions of Flanders and Wallonia, the Brussels-Capital Region constitutes one of the country’s three main political divisions. As the seat of the EU, Brussels is known as the “capital of Europe,” and its significance as a centre of international governance and business makes Brussels a true global city—a status shared with such metropolises as New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo."
Benin,Porto-Novo,BEN,Africa,"Porto-Novo, city and capital of Benin. It lies on the Gulf of Guinea in western Africa. It is located on a coastal lagoon at the extreme southeastern part of the country and was probably founded in the late 16th century. The city, formerly known as Ajase, served as the capital for the Yoruba state of Popo. It later became the centre of the kingdom of Porto-Novo and flourished as a result of slave trade with the Portuguese. The ruins of some old African palaces remain, and there are many colonial-style buildings, including the old Portuguese cathedral. The city is the administrative capital of the government of Benin. Government buildings include the national archives and the library. Porto-Novo is connected by road and rail to the country’s main industrial centre at Cotonou and by road to Lagos, Nigeria. It has been somewhat bypassed for commercial and industrial development since the building of a railway to the interior and the improvement of deepwater harbour facilities in Cotonou. Numerous African artisans and guilds are in the city."
Bhutan,Thimphu,BTN,Asia,"Thimphu, also spelled Thimbu, capital of Bhutan. The city, situated in the west-central part of the country, is in the Himalaya Mountains on the Raidak (also called Thimphu, or Wong) River at about 7,000 feet (2,000 metres) above sea level. It was designated the official seat of government in 1962 (formerly the seat was wherever the king resided), and a large construction program was undertaken with Indian aid. Tashi Chho dzong (fortress, or castle), the traditional fortified monastery that has been remodeled and extended to house the offices of the royal government, is one of the finest specimens of traditional Bhutanese architecture. Terraced fields around the royal palace indicate the high priority given to agriculture. The principal crops in the area are rice, corn (maize), and wheat. Lumbering is also important, and there is a sawmill in the city. A hydroelectric power plant began operation in 1966. The city has an airplane landing strip, and the Indo-Bhutan National Highway (opened 1968) connects the capital to Phuntsholing, the principal gateway into Bhutan from India"
Bosnia and Herzegovina,Sarajevo,BIH,Europe,"Sarajevo, capital and cultural centre of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It lies in the narrow valley of the Miljacka River at the foot of Mount Trebević. The city retains a strong Muslim character, having many mosques, wooden houses with ornate interiors, and the ancient Turkish marketplace (the Baščaršija); much of the population is Muslim. The city’s principal mosques are the Gazi Husreff-Bey’s Mosque, or Begova Džamija (1530), and the Mosque of Ali Pasha (1560–61). Husreff-Bey also built the medrese (madrasah), a Muslim school of theology; the Imaret, a free kitchen for the poor; and the hamam, public baths. A late 16th-century clock tower is adjacent to the Begova Džamija. Museums include the Mlada Bosna (“Young Bosnia”), an annex of the town museum; the Museum of the Revolution, chronicling the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1878; and a Jewish museum. Sarajevo has a university (1949) that includes faculties in mining and technology, an academy of sciences, an art college, and several hospitals. A number of streets named for trades survive from an original 37, and the Kazandžviluk (coppersmith’s bazaar) is preserved in its original form. Near Sarajevo are the remains of a Neolithic settlement of the Butmir culture. The Romans established a rest centre at nearby Ilidža, where the Bosna River has its source; there is still a sulfurous spa. The Goths, followed by the Slavs, began settling in the area about the 7th century. In 1415 Sarajevo is mentioned as Vrhbosna, and, after the Turks invaded in the late 15th century, the town developed as a trading centre and stronghold of Muslim culture. Dubrovnik merchants built the Latin quarter (Latinluk), and migrating Sephardic Jews founded their quarter, Čifuthani. The 17th and 18th centuries were less fortunate—Prince Eugene of Savoy burned the town in 1697, while fires and plagues decimated the population."
Botswana,Gaborone,BWA,Africa,"Gaborone, formerly (until 1969) Gaberones, town, capital of Botswana. The seat of government was transferred there from Mafeking (now spelled Mafikeng), South Africa, in 1965, one year before Botswana became independent of Britain. Gaborone is located on the Cape-Zimbabwe railway and is the site of government offices, parliament buildings, health facilities, a thermal power station, and an airport. It is the seat of the University of Botswana (founded 1976), and it also has a national museum and art gallery (1968), which includes departments of natural history, archaeology, and prehistory."
Brunei Darussalam,Bandar Seri Begawan,BRN,Asia,"The city lies along the Brunei River near its mouth on Brunei Bay, an inlet of the South China Sea on the northern coast of the island of Borneo. Bandar Seri Begawan was once predominantly an agricultural trade centre and river port."
Bulgaria,Sofia,BGR,Europe,"Sofia, Bulgarian Sofiya, capital of Bulgaria. It is situated near the geographical centre of the Balkans region, in the Sofia Basin, a troughlike valley in the western part of the country. The Serdi (Sardi), a Thracian tribe, established a settlement in the region in the 8th century bce. This community was conquered soon after 29 bce by the Romans, who named it Serdica (Greek: Sardica). It flourished during the reign of the emperor Trajan (98–117) and reached its greatest height under the emperor Constantine I the Great; in 342 or 343 it was the site of an important meeting of Christian bishops, the Council of Sardica. From the 4th century it was part of the Western Roman Empire, but with the decline of Rome passed to Byzantium; it was plundered by Attila and the Huns in 441–447. During the 6th century Byzantine influence increased under the emperor Justinian, and the restored Church of St. Sofia, which later gave the town its name, survives from this period. In 809 the Bulgarian khan Krum seized the town and incorporated it in the Bulgarian state; it was given the Slav name Sredets (Greek: Triaditsa). It was under Byzantine rule from 1018 until 1185, when the second Bulgarian Empire was established."
Burundi,Bujumbura,BDI,Africa,"Bujumbura, city, western Burundi. Bujumbura is the nation’s capital and largest urban centre. The city’s industry specializes in textiles, leather, paper, chemicals, and agricultural products. Bujumbura also serves as the country’s main port on Lake Tanganyika; most of Burundi’s foreign trade is shipped between the capital and Kigoma, Tanzania, and, less frequently, to Kalemi, Congo (Kinshasa). The surrounding region yields bananas, cassava (manioc), beans, corn (maize), wheat, and cotton. There is an international airport directly northwest of the city and road connections with Bukavu and Goma in Congo and Kigali in Rwanda. The University of Burundi (founded 1960) and the Centre of Burundi Civilization are two of the city’s most important cultural institutions. The city was the epicentre of an ethnically inspired civil war in the 1990s and early 21st century."
Central African Republic,Bangui,CAF,Africa,"Bangui, city, capital of the Central African Republic, located on the west bank of the Ubangi River. It is connected by an extended 1,100-mile (1,800-km) river-and-rail transport system with Pointe-Noire on the west-central African coast and with Brazzaville (both in the Republic of the Congo). The river port development includes a quay 1,300 feet (400 metres) long and an oil port downstream. Diamonds, cotton, timber, coffee, and sisal are shipped from Bangui. The city is served by Bangui-Mpoko International Airport and by ferry service to Zongo, Democratic Republic of the Congo. There is also a network of roads connecting Bangui with Cameroon, Chad, and the upper Central African Republic. Industries in Bangui include soap making and brewing, but the city is mainly a commercial and administrative centre. Bangui is the site of the University of Bangui (1969), the National School of Arts (1966), and several scientific and technological research institutes. The Boganda Museum in Bangui exhibits traditional musical instruments, weapons, village architecture, hunting tools, pottery, and religious objects. The city suffered significant looting and damage during the coup attempts of the late 1990s and early 2000s."
Comoros,Moroni,COM,Africa,"Moroni, coastal town, capital, and largest settlement of Comoros, southwestern Grande Comore (also called Njazidja) island in the Indian Ocean. It was founded by Arabic-speaking settlers, possibly as early as the 10th century ad. Dzaoudzi, the principal city of the island of Mayotte, was the original administrative capital of Comoros, but Moroni succeeded it in 1958. The port of Moroni consists of a small quay in a natural cove and lacks natural protection for shipping. Vanilla, cacao, and coffee are exported from the port, whose facilities include warehouse storage for imports and exports and for petroleum products. Moroni’s industries manufacture soft drinks, processed and distilled essential oils, metal and wood products, and processed pozzolana (cement). Despite the presence of modern-style office buildings, Moroni retains a traditional Arabic appearance. The city has numerous mosques, including Chiounda, a pilgrimage centre. Roads link Moroni with the coastal towns of Hahaia to the north and Mitsoudje to the south, and an international airport is nearby."
Croatia,Zagreb,HRV,Europe,"Capital city of Croatia. It is situated on the slopes of Medvednica Hill (Zagrebačka Gora) to the north and the floodplain of the Sava River to the south. Zagreb’s old town consists of two medieval settlements on the hill: Grič, the civil settlement, which was renamed Gradec (“Fortress”)"
Cyprus,Nicosia,CYP,Europe,"Nicosia, Greek Lefkosía, Turkish Lefkoşa, city and capital of the Republic of Cyprus. It lies along the Pedieos River, in the centre of the Mesaoria Plain between the Kyrenia Mountains (north) and the Troodos range (south). The city is also the archiepiscopal seat of the autocephalous (having the right to elect its own archbishop and bishops) Church of Cyprus. Nicosia came successively under the control of the Byzantines (330–1191), the Lusignan kings (1192–1489), the Venetians (1489–1571), the Turks (1571–1878), and the British (1878–1960), and thus reflects the vicissitudes of Cypriot history and both Eastern and Western influences. Nicosia, known in antiquity as Ledra, is a medieval corruption of the Byzantine name Lefkosia. The city was a kingdom in the 7th century bce and has been a bishopric from the 4th century ce. It has been the seat of government of Cyprus since the 10th century. The city’s walled fortifications, originally erected by the Lusignan kings and later rebuilt by the Venetians to encompass a smaller area (3 miles [5 km] round), did not prevent invasions by the Genoese in 1373, the Mamlūks in 1426, and the Turks in 1570. Standing in mute testimony to the religious and political changes of the city is the Cathedral of St. Sophia. Begun in 1209, completed in 1325, and pillaged by invaders, it was converted into the chief mosque of Cyprus in 1571. In 1954 its name was changed to the Selimiye Mosque in honour of the Ottoman sultan Selim II, under whose reign Cyprus was conquered."
Côte d'Ivoire,Yamoussoukro,CIV,Africa,"Yamoussoukro, town and capital (de jure), south-central Côte d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast), located about 170 miles (274 km) northwest of the country’s de facto capital, Abidjan. Although Yamoussoukro was officially named the new national capital in 1983, the transfer of government functions proceeded slowly, and Abidjan remained the de facto capital into the 21st century. For more than three decades after Côte d’Ivoire achieved independence in 1960, Yamoussoukro served as the country’s “second capital” because it was the birthplace, home, and unofficial headquarters of President Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Côte d’Ivoire’s head of state from 1960 to 1993. The town housed the assembly hall of the Democratic Party of Côte d’Ivoire (Parti Démocratique de la Côte d’Ivoire), the country’s only political party until 1990. Yamoussoukro became a major urban centre largely because of Houphouët-Boigny’s influence, with a dense infrastructure of roads and public utilities. The fishing, forestry, and perfume industries play important roles in the town’s economy. Sites of cultural importance in Yamoussoukro include the Yamoussoukro Basilica, which is modeled after St. Peter’s in Vatican City; a large mosque; other churches; and secondary schools."
The Democratic Republic of the Congo,Kinshasa,COD,Africa,"Kinshasa, formerly (until 1966) Léopoldville, largest city and capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It lies about 320 miles (515 km) from the Atlantic Ocean on the south bank of the Congo River. One of the largest cities of sub-Saharan Africa, it is a special political unit equivalent to a Congolese region, with its own governor. The city’s inhabitants are popularly known as Kinois. Kinshasa is not only the capital but also the centre of the dynamic and contradictory influences that have shaped the country’s character in modern Africa. The only city not clearly identified with any particular region of the country, it was until 1997 the seat of a long-lasting Zairean military government based, on the one hand, on the strength of the armed forces and, on the other, on a technique of political and social compromise that until its later years gained the rather grudging collaboration of most of the citizens. Caught between spectacular wealth and massive poverty, most Kinois must spend a considerable amount of their time scrambling for necessities that are in erratic supply. Nevertheless, they have found the means to make Kinshasa a source of distinctive influence in intellectual and popular culture felt throughout Africa."
Denmark,Copenhagen,DNK,Europe,"Capital and largest city of Denmark. It is located on the islands of Zealand (Sjælland) and Amager, at the southern end of The Sound (Øresund)."
Djibouti,Djibouti,DJI,Africa,"The French seized a small coastal area at the entrance to the Red Sea during the “scramble for Africa” in the late 19th century. At that time the only local historical flag was the plain red banner of the former sultanate of Tajoura. The name for the coastal area, before it was changed to French Territory of the Afars and Issas, had been French Somaliland. Changing political circumstances in the 20th century resulted in the independence of the area as a new country, which took on the name of its capital city, Djibouti. As in many other lands, the flag of a political party eventually was adapted to become the new national flag. The current flag is based on a design that was used by the Liberation Front of the Coast of the Somalis, an organization allied with the African People’s League for Independence. It was officially hoisted on June 27, 1977, when independence was achieved. Djibouti is a multiethnic state, as reflected in the design of the flag. The Issa are a subgroup of the Somali, whereas the Afar, or Danakil, are related to people living across the border in Ethiopia; both are Muslim. The Afar colour is green, symbolic of prosperity. The Issa colour is light blue, symbolizing sea and sky and referring to the background colour of the national flag of neighbouring Somalia. In addition, the Djibouti flag has a triangle standing for equality, its white colour symbolizing peace. It bears a star for unity, coloured red for independence."
Timor-Leste,Dili,TLS,Asia,"Dili, also spelled Dilly or Dilli, city and capital of East Timor. It lies on Ombai Strait on the northern coast of Timor island, the easternmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. Dili is the chief port and commercial centre for East Timor; it also has an airport. The population is mostly Timorese and Atonese with minorities of Portuguese, Eurasians, and Arab Muslims. Dili was settled about 1520 by the Portuguese, who made it an administrative centre; Spanish, Dutch, and British forces also vied for control of the colony. During World War II it was occupied by the Japanese. East Timor achieved independence from Portugal in 1975, but Indonesian forces invaded and, in 1976, designated Dili the capital of East Timor (Timor Timur) propinsi (province). However, a brutal guerrilla war ensued between Indonesian and pro-independence forces, during which thousands of civilians were killed. In 1999, when the territory gained independence under UN supervision, Dili was designated the administrative centre. It became the capital when East Timor achieved full sovereignty in 2002."
Egypt,Cairo,EGY,Africa,"Cairo, Arabic Al-Qāhirah (“The Victorious”), city, capital of Egypt, and one of the largest cities in Africa. Cairo has stood for more than 1,000 years on the same site on the banks of the Nile, primarily on the eastern shore, some 500 miles (800 km) downstream from the Aswan High Dam. Located in the northeast of the country, Cairo is the gateway to the Nile delta, where the lower Nile separates into the Rosetta and Damietta branches. Metropolitan Cairo is made up of the Cairo muḥāfazah (governorate) as well as other districts, some of which belong to neighbouring governorates such as Al-Jīzah and Qalūbiyyah. Cairo is fan-shaped, narrowest in the south, where the river valley is wedged between desert escarpments, and widest in the north, where the valley blends into the delta. Over the centuries the city expanded westward, as a receding river channel left land flood-free. In response to heightened demand, however, the city also has been elongated to the north and south and has developed an expanding annex on the Nile’s western shore."
Equatorial Guinea,Malabo,GNQ,Africa,"Malabo, formerly (until 1973) Santa Isabel, capital of Equatorial Guinea. It lies on the northern edge of the island of Bioko (or Fernando Po) on the rim of a sunken volcano. With an average temperature of 77 °F (25 °C) and an annual rainfall of 75 inches (1,900 mm), it has one of the more onerous climates in the Bight of Biafra (Gulf of Guinea). Malabo is the republic’s commercial and financial centre. Its harbour, providing one of the deepest seaports in the region, can dock several ships, and the main activity is the export of cocoa, timber, and coffee. It also has an international airport with flights to Bata, in continental Equatorial Guinea, and to countries in Africa and Europe, and to the United States. The city’s European population declined after the riots of 1969 and, later, after its Nigerian contract workers returned to Nigeria in the mid-1970s. The discovery and development of the country’s oil reserves in the 1980s and ’90s led to an increase in business and development in the city."
Estonia,Tallinn,EST,Europe,"Tallinn, Russian Tallin, German Reval, formerly (until 1918) Revel, city, capital of Estonia, on Tallinn Bay of the Gulf of Finland. A fortified settlement existed there from the late 1st millennium bc until the 10th–11th century ad, and there was a town on the site in the 12th century. In 1219 it was captured by the Danes, who built a new fortress on Toompea hill. Trade flourished, especially after Tallinn joined the Hanseatic League in 1285. In 1346 it was sold to the Teutonic Knights, and on the dissolution of the order in 1561 it passed to Sweden. Peter I (the Great) captured Tallinn in 1710, and it remained a Russian city until it became the capital of independent Estonia from 1918 to 1940. (Estonia was annexed to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics from 1940 to 1991.) The city was occupied by German forces from 1941 to 1944 and was severely damaged. After the Supreme Soviet of Estonia declared independence in 1991, Tallinn became the capital of the newly independent state. Both in 1940 and again in 1944–49, many Estonian citizens of Tallinn were deported and imprisoned by Soviet forces for alleged conspiracy, collaboration with the Germans, and opposition to collectivization. Of those exiled, a large proportion settled in Sweden or North America. Russians immigrated to the Estonian capital and now comprise two-fifths of the population. Ethnic Estonians make up roughly half of the city’s population."
Finland,Helsinki,FIN,Europe,"Helsinki, Swedish Helsingfors, capital of Finland. It is the leading seaport and industrial city of the nation. Helsinki lies in the far south of the country, on a peninsula that is fringed by fine natural harbours and that protrudes into the Gulf of Finland. It is the most northerly of continental European capitals. It is often called the “white city of the north” because many of its buildings are constructed of a local light-coloured granite. Helsinki was founded in 1550 by King Gustav I Vasa of Sweden and was intended to compete with the city of Reval (now Tallinn, Estonia), which lies on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland. Helsinki was originally located at the mouth of the Vantaa River, at a point about 3 mi (4.8 km) north of its present-day location, and was moved down to the latter site in 1640 in order to obtain more open access to the sea. The town was ravaged by a plague in 1710 and burned to the ground in 1713. Its redevelopment was hindered by Russian attacks later in the 18th century, but in 1748 the settlement became more secure when a fortress, called Sveaborg by the Swedes and Suomenlinna by the Finns, was constructed on a group of small islands outside the harbour."
France,Paris,FRA,Europe,"Paris, city and capital of France, situated in the north-central part of the country. People were living on the site of the present-day city, located along the Seine River some 233 miles (375 km) upstream from the river’s mouth on the English Channel (La Manche), by about 7600 bce. The modern city has spread from the island (the Île de la Cité) and far beyond both banks of the Seine. Paris occupies a central position in the rich agricultural region known as the Paris Basin, and it constitutes one of eight départements of the Île-de-France administrative region. It is by far the country’s most important centre of commerce and culture."
Gabon,Libreville,GAB,Africa,"Libreville, city and capital of Gabon, located on the north shore of the Gabon Estuary, which empties into the Gulf of Guinea. It is built on a succession of hills overlooking a well-sheltered port. The former European sector (modern in appearance and the site of the principal administrative and commercial buildings) climbs a plateau that rises from the sea; traditional African villages partially surround this community, ending at the estuary. The international airport is 7 miles (11 km) north, and a growing system of roads links the city with towns in the interior. Pongoue (Mpongwe) people first settled the estuary after the 16th century, followed by the Fang, who had migrated south from the Cameroon area, in the 19th century. Fort-d’Aumale was built by the French in 1843 on the estuary’s north bank, and a Catholic mission was founded a year later. In 1849 a settlement of freed slaves from the ship “Elizia” and a group of Pongoue villages were given the name Libreville (meaning “free town”). In 1850 the French abandoned their fort and resettled on the plateau that is now the site of the administrative and commercial sector. Between 1860 and 1874, the British, Germans, and Americans established businesses in Libreville, which from 1888 to 1904 was the capital of French Equatorial Africa."
Gambia,Banjul,GMB,Africa,"Banjul, formerly (until 1973) Bathurst, city, capital, and Atlantic port of The Gambia, on St. Mary’s Island, near the mouth of the Gambia River. It is the country’s largest city. It was founded in 1816, when the British Colonial Office ordered Captain Alexander Grant to establish a military post on the river to suppress the slave trade and to serve as a trade outlet for merchants ejected from Senegal, which had been restored to France. Grant chose Banjul Island (ceded by the chief of Kombo) as the site, which he renamed St. Mary’s. He named the new settlement for Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst, then colonial secretary. It became the capital of the British colony and protectorate of Gambia and after 1947 was governed by a town council. With The Gambia’s independence in 1965, the town was granted city status and became the national capital. The name was changed to Banjul in 1973."
Germany,Berlin,DEU,Europe,"Berlin, capital and chief urban centre of Germany. The city lies at the heart of the North German Plain, athwart an east-west commercial and geographic axis that helped make it the capital of the kingdom of Prussia and then, from 1871, of a unified Germany. Berlin’s former glory ended in 1945, but the city survived the destruction of World War II. It was rebuilt and came to show amazing economic and cultural growth. Germany’s division after the war put Berlin entirely within the territory of the German Democratic Republic (GDR, or East Germany). The city itself echoed the national partition—East Berlin being the capital of East Germany and West Berlin a Land (state) of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, or West Germany). West Berlin’s isolation was later reinforced by the concrete barrier erected in 1961 and known as the Berlin Wall. Its status as an enclave made Berlin a continuous focus of confrontation between the Eastern and Western powers as well as a symbol of Western lifestyle for 45 years. The fall of the East German communist regime—and the accompanying opening of the wall—in late 1989 unexpectedly raised the prospect for Berlin’s reinstatement as the all-German capital. That status was restored in 1990 under the terms of the unification treaty, and subsequently Berlin was designated a state, one of the 16 constituting Germany. These developments heralded the city’s return to its historic position of prominence in European culture and commerce."
Ghana,Accra,GHA,Africa,"Accra, capital and largest city of Ghana, on the Gulf of Guinea (an arm of the Atlantic Ocean). The city lies partly on a cliff, 25 to 40 feet (8 to 12 metres) high, and spreads northward over the undulating Accra plains. The area’s susceptibility to faulting is the cause of occasional earthquakes. When the Portuguese first settled on the coast of what is now Ghana in 1482, the present site of Accra was occupied by several villages of the Ga tribe, ruled from a parent settlement, Ayaso (Ayawaso), located about 15 miles (24 km) north. Between 1650 and 1680 the Europeans built three fortified trading posts—Fort James (English), Fort Crevecoeur (Dutch), and Christiansborg Castle (Danish)—along the coast in the locality. While these European posts were being constructed, Ayaso was destroyed in a tribal war, and its population, together with that of the other major Ga towns on the Accra plains, was drawn to the coast by the prospect of profitable trade with the Europeans. As a result, three coastal villages—Osu (Christiansborg), Dutch Accra (later called Ussher Town), and James Town—sprang up, becoming the nuclei of what was to be Accra. The name Accra itself is a corruption of the Akan word nkran. It refers to the black ants that abound in the vicinity. It came to be applied to the inhabitants of this part of the Accra plains."
Greece,Athens,GRC,Europe,"Athens, Modern Greek Athínai, Ancient Greek Athēnai, historic city and capital of Greece. Many of Classical civilization’s intellectual and artistic ideas originated there, and the city is generally considered to be the birthplace of Western civilization. Athens lies 5 miles (8 km) from the Bay of Phaleron, an inlet of the Aegean (Aigaíon) Sea where Piraeus (Piraiévs), the port of Athens, is situated, in a mountain-girt arid basin divided north-south by a line of hills. Greater Athens has an area of 165 square miles (427 square km). The Kifisós River, only a trickle in summer, flows through the western half; the Ilisós River, often dry, traverses the eastern half. The surrounding mountains—Párnis, 4,636 feet (1,413 metres); Pentelicus (Pendéli), 3,631 feet; Hymettos (Imittós), 3,365 feet; and Aigáleon, 1,535 feet—add to the impression of barrenness. Yet such considerations are superficial when compared with the fecundity of Athens’s bequests to the world, such as its philosophy, its architecture, its literature, and its political ideals. For treatment of the city in its regional setting, see Greece; historical and cultural aspects are treated further in the article ancient Greek civilization."
India,New Delhi,IND,Asia,"New Delhi, national capital of India. It is situated in the north-central part of the country on the west bank of the Yamuna River, adjacent to and just south of Delhi city (Old Delhi) and within the Delhi national capital territory. In December 1911 King George V of Britain decreed that the capital of British India would be moved from Calcutta (now Kolkata) to Delhi. Construction began in 1912 at a site about 3 miles (5 km) south of the Delhi city centre, and the new capital was formally dedicated in 1931. The straight and diagonal pattern of the broad tree-lined avenues in New Delhi, with extensive green spaces and wide vistas, contrasts sharply with the crowded, narrow, and winding streets characteristic of Old Delhi. The main east-west axis of New Delhi is Central Vista Park, which is flanked by government buildings, museums, and research centres in a parklike setting. The city is governed by the appointed New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC)."
Indonesia,Jakarta,IDN,Asia,"Djakarta, largest city and capital of Indonesia. Jakarta lies on the northwest coast of Java at the mouth of the Ciliwung (Liwung River), on Jakarta Bay (an embayment of the Java Sea). It is coextensive with the metropolitan district of Greater Jakarta (Jakarta Raya) and nearly coextensive with the daerah khusus ibukota (special capital district) of Jakarta—the latter also including a number of small offshore islands in the Java Sea. In 1966, when the city was declared a special capital district, it gained a status approximately equivalent to that of a state or province. The city has long been a major trade and financial centre. It has also become an important industrial city and a centre for education."
Islamic Republic of Iran,Tehran,IRN,Asia,"Tehrān, also spelled Teheran, the capital city of Iran and the centre of the province (ostān) of Tehrān, located in north-central Iran at the foot of the Elburz mountain range. Since its establishment as the capital city by Āghā Moḥammad Khān more than 200 years ago, Tehrān has grown from a small city to a major metropolis: situated in an urban region of 14 million inhabitants, Tehrān is Iran’s largest city and one of the most populous cities of the world."
Iraq,Baghdad,IRQ,Asia,"Baghdad, also spelled Bagdad, Arabic Baghdād, formerly Madīnat al-Salām (Arabic: “City of Peace”), city, capital of Iraq and capital of Baghdad governorate, central Iraq. Its location, on the Tigris River about 330 miles (530 km) from the headwaters of the Persian Gulf, is in the heart of ancient Mesopotamia. Baghdad is Iraq’s largest city and one of the most populous urban agglomerations of the Middle East. The city was founded in 762 as the capital of the Abbasid dynasty of caliphs, and for the next 500 years it was the most significant cultural centre of Arab and Islamic civilization and one of the greatest cities of the world. It was conquered by the Mongol leader Hülegü in 1258, after which its importance waned. A provincial capital under the Ottoman Empire, Baghdad regained prominence only when it became the capital of Iraq in 1920; over the next half century, the city grew prodigiously and took on all the characteristics of a modern metropolis. Baghdad was heavily damaged by aerial bombardment during the Persian Gulf War (1990–91) and again by air and ground operations during the Iraq War (2003–11). During the interwar period the city’s services and infrastructure deteriorated badly because of inattention and fiscal constraints resulting from economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations (UN). "
Japan,Tokyo,JPN,Asia,"Tokyo, formerly (until 1868) Edo, city and capital of Tokyo to (metropolis) and of Japan. It is located at the head of Tokyo Bay on the Pacific coast of central Honshu. It is the focus of the vast metropolitan area often called Greater Tokyo, the largest urban and industrial agglomeration in Japan. The site of Tokyo has been inhabited since ancient times; the small fishing village of Edo existed there for centuries. Edo’s development into a city did not occur until the Tokugawa period (1603–1867), when it became the capital of the Tokugawa shogunate. During this period, however, the imperial family remained in Kyōto, the ancient imperial capital. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, which ended the shogunate, the capital was moved to Edo. The city was renamed Tokyo, meaning “eastern capital.” Edo had been Japan’s largest city since the 17th century. Tokyo’s population exceeded one million in the late 19th century, and as Japan’s political, economic, and cultural centre it became one of the world’s most populous cities in the 20th century."
Jordan,Amman,JOR,Asia,"Amman, Arabic ʿAmmān, biblical Hebrew Rabbath Ammon, ancient Greek Philadelphia, capital and largest city of Jordan. It is the residence of the king and the seat of government. The city is built on rolling hills at the eastern boundary of the ʿAjlūn Mountains, on the small, partly perennial Wadi ʿAmmān and its tributaries. Amman’s focus of settlement throughout history has been the small high triangular plateau (modern Mount Al-Qalʿah) just north of the wadi. Fortified settlements have existed there since remote antiquity; the earliest remains are of the Chalcolithic Age (c. 4000–c. 3000 bce). Later the city became capital of the Ammonites, a Semitic people frequently mentioned in the Bible; the biblical and modern names both trace back to “Ammon.” The “royal city” taken by King David’s general Joab (II Samuel 12:26) was probably the acropolis atop the plateau. King David sent Uriah the Hittite to his death in battle before the walls of the city so that he might marry his wife, Bathsheba (II Samuel 11); the incident is also a part of Muslim folklore. The population of the Ammonite cities was much reduced under King David. David’s son Solomon (flourished 10th century bce) had Ammonite wives in his harem, one of whom became the mother of Rehoboam, Solomon’s successor as king of Judah."
Kazakhstan,Astana,KAZ,Asia,"Astana, formerly (until 1961) Akmolinsk, (1961–92) Tselinograd, (1992–98) Aqmola, and (2019–22) Nur-Sultan, city, capital of Kazakhstan. Astana lies in the north-central part of the country, along the Ishim River, at the junction of the Trans-Kazakhstan and South Siberian railways. It was founded in 1824 as a Russian military outpost and became an administrative centre in 1868. Its population had reached 33,000 when it was made an oblast (province) centre in 1939. The city’s importance was greatly enhanced during the Soviet period by the government’s Virgin and Idle Lands Campaign of the mid-1950s—Tselinograd was Russian for “City of the Virgin Lands”—and by the city’s role as capital of a kray (region) that united the five northern provinces of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic in 1960–65. There was much new construction and the establishment of various research and higher educational institutions (teacher training, agriculture, medicine, and engineering and construction)."
Kenya,Nairobi,KEN,Africa,"Nairobi, city, capital of Kenya. It is situated in the south-central part of the country, in the highlands at an elevation of about 5,500 feet (1,680 metres). The city lies 300 miles (480 km) northwest of Mombasa, Kenya’s major port on the Indian Ocean. The city originated in the late 1890s as a colonial railway settlement, taking its name from a water hole known to the Maasai people as Enkare Nairobi (“Cold Water”). When the railhead arrived there in 1899, the British colonial capital of Ukamba province was transferred from Machakos (now Masaku) to the site, and in 1905 Nairobi became the capital of the British East Africa Protectorate. From about 1900 onward, when a small Indian bazaar was established at Nairobi, the city was also a trading centre."
Italy,Rome,ITA,Europe,"Rome, Italian Roma, historic city and capital of Roma provincia (province), of Lazio regione (region), and of the country of Italy. Rome is located in the central portion of the Italian peninsula, on the Tiber River about 15 miles (24 km) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea. Once the capital of an ancient republic and empire whose armies and polity defined the Western world in antiquity and left seemingly indelible imprints thereafter, the spiritual and physical seat of the Roman Catholic Church, and the site of major pinnacles of artistic and intellectual achievement, Rome is the Eternal City, remaining today a political capital, a religious centre, and a memorial to the creative imagination of the past. The Roman countryside, the Campagna, was one of the last areas of central Italy to be settled in antiquity. Rome was built on a defensible hill that dominated the last downstream, high-banked river crossing where traverse of the Tiber was facilitated by a midstream island. This hill, Palatine Hill, was one of a group of hills, traditionally counted as seven, around which the ancient city grew. The other hills are the Capitoline, the Quirinal, the Viminal, the Esquiline, the Caelian, and the Aventine."
Kuwait,Kuwait City,KWT,Asia,"Kuwait, country of the Arabian Peninsula located in the northwestern corner of the Persian Gulf. A small emirate nestled between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Kuwait is situated in a section of one of the driest, least-hospitable deserts on Earth. Its shore, however, includes Kuwait Bay, a deep harbour on the Persian Gulf. There, in the 18th century, Bedouin from the interior founded a trading post. The name Kuwait is derived from the Arabic diminutive of the Hindustani kūt (“fort”). Since the emirate’s ruling family, the Āl Ṣabāḥ, formally established a sheikhdom in 1756, the country’s fortunes have been linked to foreign commerce. In time and with accumulated wealth, the small fort grew to become Kuwait city, a modern metropolis mingling skyscrapers, apartment buildings, and mosques. Kuwait city has most of the country’s population, which makes Kuwait one of the world’s most-urbanized countries."
Lao People's Democratic Republic,Vientiane,LAO,Asia,"Vientiane, also spelled Viangchan, largest city and capital of Laos, situated on a plain just northeast of the Mekong River. The city’s central river port location in a country relying heavily on its rivers for transportation and its surrounding hinterland of intensive rice cultivation have made Vientiane the major economic centre of Laos. The city has a tropical monsoon climate, every month having an average daytime temperature above 80 °F (27 °C) and more than 80 percent of Vientiane’s annual precipitation on the average falling in the five months May–September. The town was founded during the late 13th century, and in the mid-16th century the capital of the Lao kingdom (a state known as Lan Xang) was moved to Vientiane from its previous traditional location at Luang Prabang (now Louangphrabang). In 1778 Vientiane came under Siamese control; in 1828 it was sacked and destroyed when the subject Laotian king revolted against Siamese hegemony. From 1899 to 1953, with the exception of the Japanese occupation (1945), Vientiane was in succession the seat of the French governor and the French administrative capital."
Lesotho,Maseru,LSO,Africa,"Maseru, capital and largest urban centre of Lesotho. It is on the left bank of the Caledon River near the border with Free State province, South Africa. In 1869 the chief of the Sotho (Basotho) nation, Moshoeshoe, founded the town near his mountain stronghold of Thaba Bosiu; few of the 19th-century buildings remain. Lesotho is linked with the South African railway system by a short line from Maseru to Marseilles on the Bloemfontein–KwaZulu-Natal main line, thus providing an outlet for farm produce, trade, and the transport of labourers. Maseru, in turn, is linked by road and airstrips to other areas of mountainous Lesotho and by scheduled air service to Johannesburg. The National Assembly chamber buildings and the High Court buildings of Lesotho are in Maseru, as are Radio Lesotho, a technical school, and the Lesotho Agricultural College, founded in 1955. The town of Roma, 15 miles (24 km) southeast of Maseru, is the site of the National University of Lesotho (established 1975)."
Liberia,Monrovia,LBR,Africa,"Monrovia, capital, largest city, and chief Atlantic port of Liberia, located on Bushrod Island and Cape Mesurado. It was founded during the administration of U.S. Pres. James Monroe (for whom it was named) by the American Colonization Society as a settlement for freed American slaves. The first town (1822) was on Providence Island at the mouth of the Mesurado River. The population is composed of descendants of settlers from North America, most of whom arrived between 1830 and 1871, and of substantial numbers of immigrants from the interior. Bushrod Island contains the artificial harbour and free port of Monrovia, the only such port in West Africa. As the national centre of commerce and transportation, it attracted petroleum, paint, tuna, pharmaceutical, and cement enterprises. Prominent buildings have included the Capitol (1958), the Executive Mansion (1964), the City Hall, and the Temple of Justice. Many of these and other buildings, however, were severely damaged or destroyed during the fierce multisided civil war beginning in 1990."
Libya,Tripoli,LBY,Africa,"Tripoli, Arabic Ṭarābulus, in full Ṭarābulus al-Gharb (“The Western Tripoli”), capital city of Libya. Situated in northwestern Libya along the Mediterranean coast, it is the country’s largest city and chief seaport. The city was known as Oea in ancient times and was one of the original cities (along with Sabratha and Leptis Magna) that formed the African Tripolis, or Tripolitania. Occupying a rocky promontory overlooking the sea and located due south of Sicily, the city was founded by the Phoenicians and later controlled by the Romans (146 bce until about 450 ce), the Vandals (5th century), and the Byzantines (6th century). During the invasions by the Vandals the walls of the cities of Sabratha and Leptis Magna were destroyed, and this resulted in the growth of Tripoli, which had previously been the least important of the three cities. In 645 the city fell to Arab Muslims led by ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ, and it subsequently remained under Arab control (except from 1146 to 1158, when it was taken by Sicilian Normans). It was stormed by the Spanish in 1510 and was conquered by the Turks in 1551, after which it was made a colonial capital of the Ottoman Empire. From 1911 to 1943 it was in Italian hands, and from then until Libya’s independence in 1951 it was occupied by the British."
Liechtenstein,Vaduz,LIE,Europe,"Vaduz, capital of Liechtenstein, central Europe, in the Rhine Valley. The seat of one of the two former lordships (Schellenberg and Vaduz) that united to form the principality in 1719, Vaduz is a flourishing tourist centre and the residence of the ruling prince, whose castle overlooks the town. Mentioned in a document of c. 1322, destroyed in the Swabian Wars (1499), and rebuilt in the following centuries, the castle was restored in 1905–16 in 16th-century style. Although it has belonged to the princes since 1712, Francis Joseph II, who succeeded to the monarchy in 1938, was the first to make it his permanent residence. The town’s Fürst Liechtensteinische Gemäldegalerie displays parts of the world-famous art collection of the princes of Liechtenstein. The State Art Collection includes works by 20th-century painters, and the Liechtenstein Postal Museum has a collection of stamps, including all of those issued by the country since 1912"
Lithuania,Vilnius,LTU,Europe,"Vilnius, Russian Vilnyus, Polish Wilno, Russian (formerly) Vilna, city, capital of Lithuania, at the confluence of the Neris (Russian Viliya) and Vilnia rivers. A settlement existed on the site in the 10th century, and the first documentary reference to it dates from 1128. In 1323 the town became capital of Lithuania under Grand Duke Gediminas; it was destroyed in 1377 by the Teutonic Knights. Subsequently rebuilt, Vilnius received its charter of self-government in 1387, and a Roman Catholic bishopric was established there. The town and its trade flourished and grew; in 1525 a printing press was set up, and in 1579 a Jesuit academy was opened. The city underwent many calamities—Russian occupation in 1655–60, Swedish capture in 1702 and 1706, French occupation in 1812, and recurrent fires and plagues. In 1795 Vilnius passed to Russia in the Third Partition of Poland. It was occupied by the Germans in World Wars I and II and suffered heavy damage. From 1920 to 1939 it was included in Poland (see Vilnius dispute); it was taken by Soviet troops in 1939 and restored to Lithuania. The Soviets annexed Lithuania, including Vilnius, in June 1940. Soviet rule brought mass deportations (1940–41, 1946–50) of ethnic Lithuanians from Vilnius, and many Russians moved into the city. In 1970 the population of Vilnius was 43 percent ethnically Lithuanian (up from 34 percent in 1959) and 18 percent Polish. In 1991 Vilnius again became the capital of independent Lithuania."
Madagascar,Antananarivo,MDG,Africa,"Antananarivo, formerly Tananarive, town and national capital of Madagascar, central Madagascar island. It was founded in the 17th century and was the capital of the Hova chiefs. Antananarivo stands on a high hill. Avenues and flights of steps lead up to a rocky ridge (4,694 feet [1,431 metres]) on which stands the Royal Estate, with towered palaces built by the Imerina kings who captured the town in 1794 and ruled until the end of the 19th century. Below are banks and administrative buildings and lower still the commercial quarter. Public buildings include the French Residency and the Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals, and there are research institutes, an observatory, and the Bibliothèque Nationale. The University of Madagascar was founded there in 1961. Industries include tobacco and food processing and the manufacture of leather goods and clothing. Air transport is widely used, and the international airport at Ivato is 11 miles (17 km) north of the city. A railway connects the capital with Toamasina, the island’s chief port, to the east, as well as with Antsirabe to the south and Lake Alaotra to the north."
Malaysia,Kuala Lumpur,MYS,Asia,"Kuala Lumpur, capital of Malaysia. The city is located in west-central Peninsular (West) Malaysia, midway along the west coast tin and rubber belt and about 25 miles (40 km) east of its ocean port, Port Kelang, on the Strait of Malacca. It is the country’s largest urban area and its cultural, commercial, and transportation centre. In 1972 Kuala Lumpur was designated a municipality, and in 1974 this entity and adjacent portions of surrounding Selangor state became a federal territory. Kuala Lumpur lies in hilly country astride the confluence of the Kelang and Gombak rivers; its name in Malay means “muddy estuary.” Malaysia’s Main Range rises nearby to the north, east, and southeast. The climate is equatorial, with high temperatures and humidity that vary little throughout the year. The area receives about 95 inches (2,400 mm) of rain annually; June and July are the driest months."
Mali,Bamako,MLI,Africa,"Bamako, capital of Mali, located on the Niger River in the southwestern part of the country. When occupied for the French in 1880 by Captain Joseph-Simon Gallieni, Bamako was a settlement of a few hundred inhabitants, grouped in villages. It became the capital of the former colony of French Sudan in 1908, four years after the Kayes–Bamako segment of the Dakar–Niger Railway (now the Regie des Chemins de Fer du Mali) was opened. Bamako now spans both sides of the Niger River, which is navigable 225 miles (360 km) south, to Kouroussa, Guinea, from mid-June to mid-December. To the north a canal around the Sotuba Rapids has opened the northeastern section of the river to shipping as far as Gao (869 miles [1,398 km]). Cement and petroleum products are shipped downstream from Bamako, with rice and groundnuts (peanuts) coming upstream for transshipment via the railway. The city is also served by an airport."
Malta,Valletta,MLT,Europe,"Valletta, also spelled Valetta, seaport and capital of Malta, on the northeast coast of the island of Malta. The nucleus of the city is built on the promontory of Mount Sceberras that runs like a tongue into the middle of a bay, which it thus divides into two harbours, Grand Harbour to the east and Marsamxett Harbour to the west. Built after the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, which checked the advance of Ottoman power in southern Europe, it was named for Jean Parisot de la Valette, grand master of the order of Hospitallers (Knights of St. John of Jerusalem), and became Malta’s capital in 1570. The Hospitallers were driven out by the French in 1798, and a Maltese revolt against the French garrison led to Valletta’s seizure by the British in 1800. After 1814 the city became a strategic British Mediterranean naval and military base of the first order; it was subjected to severe bombing raids in World War II and was the place where the Italian fleet surrendered to the Allies in 1943."
Mauritius,Port Louis,MUS,Africa,"Port Louis, city, capital, and main port of the island of Mauritius in the western Indian Ocean. It lies between a well-sheltered, deepwater harbour, accessible to ships through a break in the coral reef, and a semicircle of mountains. Port Louis was founded about 1736 by the French as a calling place for ships rounding the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa) on the passage between Asia and Europe. British occupation of the island during the Napoleonic Wars (1800–15) was a strategic factor in securing control of the Indian Ocean, but the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 resulted in the port being bypassed by shipping. Port activity increased during the closure of the Suez Canal (1967–75), and the harbour was modernized in the late 1970s. The city is the central collecting and clearing point for all imports and exports from Mauritius and its dependencies and is connected by road to the rest of the island. Sugar exports, once the mainstay of the economy, have been superceded in importance by manufacturing (notably textiles) and services (notably tourism)."
Moldova (the Republic of),Chisinau,MDA,Europe,"Chișinău, formerly Kishinyov, also spelled Kishinev or Kišin’ov, city and capital of Moldova (Moldavia). It is situated along the Bâcu (Byk) River, in the south-central part of the country. The first documentary reference to Chișinău dates from 1466, when it was under the rule of the Moldavian prince Ștefan III. After Ștefan’s death the city fell under the control of the Ottoman Turks. Gradually Chișinău’s trading importance increased, though the city suffered severe destruction in the Russo-Turkish War of 1788. In 1812 Chișinău was ceded to Russia with the rest of Bessarabia. It was henceforth known by its Russian name, Kishinyov."
Monaco,Monaco,MCO,Europe,"Monaco, officially Principality of Monaco, French Principauté de Monaco, sovereign principality located along the Mediterranean Sea in the midst of the resort area of the Côte d’Azur (French Riviera). The city of Nice, France, lies 9 miles (15 km) to the west, the Italian border 5 miles (8 km) to the east. Monaco’s tiny territory occupies a set of densely clustered hills and a headland that looks southward over the Mediterranean. Many unusual features, however, have made Monaco among the most luxurious tourist resorts in the world and have given it a fame far exceeding its size. Many visitors to Monaco alternate their hours between its beaches and boating facilities, its international sports-car races, and its world-famous Place du Casino, the gambling centre in the Monte-Carlo section that made Monte-Carlo an international byword for the extravagant display and reckless dispersal of wealth."
Mongolia,Ulaanbaatar,MNG,Asia,"Ulaanbaatar, also spelled Ulan Bator, formerly Urga or Niislel Khureheh, capital and largest city of Mongolia. It is situated on the Tuul River on a windswept plateau at an elevation of 4,430 feet (1,350 m). The city originated as a seasonal migratory abode of the Mongolian princes and in 1639 finally attained permanence on the present site with the construction of Da Khure Monastery. This building became the residence of the bodgo-gegen, high priest of the Tibetan Buddhist religion (to which the Mongols adhere), and remained as such for about 200 years. Da Khure became known to the Russians as Urga and developed as a trade centre between China and Russia. In 1911, when Outer Mongolia declared itself independent, the city was renamed Niislel Khureheh (“Capital of Mongolia”). In 1921 it was occupied by troops of Mongolia’s revolutionary leader, Damdiny Sühbaatar, and the Soviet Red Army. When Mongolia was declared a people’s republic in 1924, the city was renamed Ulaanbaatar, which means “Red Hero.”"
Montenegro,Podgorica,MNE,Europe,"Podgorica, formerly (1946–92) Titograd, city, administrative centre of Montenegro. It is situated in southern Montenegro near the confluence of the Ribnica and Morača rivers. The first recorded settlement was Birziminium, a caravan stop in Roman times, though it probably was an Illyrian tribal centre earlier. As a feudal state capital in the early Middle Ages, it was known as Ribnica; it was called Podgorica from 1326. It fell to the Turks in 1474 but was restored to Montenegro in 1878. In 1916 it was occupied by the Austrians, in 1941 by the Italians, and in 1943 by the Germans. Only the Turkish clock tower (late 18th century), a mosque, and several houses survived the destruction of the old city in World War II. The city’s bloody history is portrayed through a large number of war memorials. In the postwar communist period the city was known as Titograd in honour of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito. After the collapse of communism, the city revived its old name, Podgorica, in 1992. Podgorica has several cultural and educational institutions, including the University of Montenegro (1974). Manufactures are mainly consumer items; in 1972 an aluminum works began exploiting rich bauxite deposits nearby."
Morocco,Rabat,MAR,Africa,"Rabat, Arabic Ribāṭ, city and capital of Morocco. One of the country’s four imperial cities, it is located on the Atlantic coast at the mouth of the Wadi Bou Regreg, opposite the city of Salé. The history of Rabat is closely connected to that of Salé, the site of which was first occupied by the Roman settlement of Sala (Shella). During the 10th century, Salé was established by the Zanātah Imazighen (Berbers), who were Sunni Muslims, to house the nonconformist Barghawāṭah Imazighen."
Mozambique,Maputo,MOZ,Africa,"Maputo, formerly (until 1976) Lourenço Marques, port city and capital of Mozambique. It lies along the north bank of Espírito Santo Estuary of Delagoa Bay, an inlet of the Indian Ocean. Maputo derived its former name from the Portuguese trader who first explored the region in 1544. The town developed around a Portuguese fortress completed in 1787. Created a city town in 1887, it superseded the town of Moçambique as the capital of Portuguese East Africa in 1907. Maputo has a healthful climate, tempered by sea breezes. The city has a natural history museum and a university (1962). Its fine bathing beaches made it a popular resort for white South Africans and Rhodesians before Mozambique became independent in 1975; thereafter, revenues from tourism, once a major economic factor, virtually ended."
Myanmar,Naypyidaw,MMR,Asia,"Nay Pyi Taw, (Burmese: “Abode of Kings”) also spelled Nay Pyi Daw or Naypyidaw, city, capital of Myanmar (Burma). Nay Pyi Taw was built in the central basin of Myanmar in the early 21st century to serve as the country’s new administrative centre. In 2004 construction of Nay Pyi Taw began on an isolated site near the city of Pyinmana, some 200 miles (320 km) north of the then capital city of Yangon (formerly Rangoon). Holding that relocation of the capital would facilitate accessibility of the government from all parts of the country, the administration began its move in 2005, first to Pyinmana and then to Nay Pyi Taw, which was proclaimed the capital in March 2006. In its early years Nay Pyi Taw consisted of little more than government buildings, luxury hotels, apartments, and an airport, and it was populated primarily by civil servants, many of whose families remained in Yangon because of the lack of shops, restaurants, and other amenities in the new capital. Despite its limited facilities, the burgeoning city was provided with an uninterrupted supply of electricity—a rarity elsewhere in the country. Use of the airport at Nay Pyi Taw generally has been restricted to military personnel; otherwise, the city is accessible by road or by rail (with a station at nearby Pyinmana) from Yangon."
Turkmenistan,Ashgabat,TKM,Asia,"Ashgabat, formerly Ashkhabad, Ashkabad, Askhabad, or (1919–27) Poltoratsk, city and capital of Turkmenistan. It lies in an oasis at the northern foot of the Kopet-Dag (Turkmen: Köpetdag) Range and on the edge of the Karakum (Turkmen: Garagum) Desert, about 19 miles (30 km) from the Iranian frontier. It was founded in 1881 as a Russian military fort and took the name of the nearby Turkmen settlement of Askhabad. It became the administrative centre of the Transcaspian oblast (province) and, because of its position on the caravan routes and on the Transcaspian Railway, attracted a population that numbered more than 45,000 by 1911. After the Russian Revolution the city soon was renamed Poltoratsk, after a local revolutionary. From 1924 to 1990 it was the capital of Turkmenistan, U.S.S.R.; in 1927 it reverted to its original name, Ashkhabad. One of the most violent earthquakes ever registered in the region virtually destroyed the city in October 1948; it was rebuilt on the same regular plan. A chronic water shortage was alleviated considerably when the Karakum Canal reached the city in 1962. In 1992 the government of newly independent Turkmenistan officially adopted the Turkmen version of the city’s name, Ashgabat.

Ashgabat is now an administrative, industrial, transportation, and cultural centre. The city has glassworks, carpet-weaving and cotton mills, and metalworking shops. Its spectacular natural setting also made it a centre for the filmmaking industry. There are several institutions of higher education, including Turkmen A.M. Gorkii State University (1950) and polytechnic, agricultural, and medical institutes."
Namibia,Windhoek,NAM,Africa,"Windhoek, town, capital of Namibia, located roughly in the centre of the country. It lies at an elevation of 5,428 feet (1,654 metres) and is about 400 miles (650 km) north of the Orange River and 760 miles (1,225 km) north of Cape Town, South Africa. The town is surrounded by dry, arid country, but a circular chain of hills protects it from excessive dry winds. Before European settlement began, the town was known as Aigams, meaning “hot water,” in reference to the hot springs in the region. The area was initially settled by Khoekhoe and Herero peoples. In 1890 the site of the present town was claimed for the German government. In 1915 South African forces occupied Windhoek and initiated their claim for the country, then known as South West Africa. When Namibia became independent in 1990, Windhoek transformed from a territorial capital into a national capital."
Nepal,Kathmandu,NPL,Asia,"Kathmandu, also spelled Katmandu or Kantipur, capital of Nepal. It lies in a hilly region near the confluence of the Baghmati and Vishnumati rivers, at an elevation of 4,344 feet (1,324 metres) above sea level. It was founded in 723 by Raja Gunakamadeva. Its early name was Manju-Patan; the present name refers to a wooden temple (kath, “wood”; mandir, “temple” or “edifice”) said to have been built from the wood of a single tree by Raja Lachmina Singh in 1596. A building, supposedly the original, still stands in the central square and is used for the accommodation of sadhus (holy men). Kathmandu served as the seat of the ruling Shah family of the Gurkha people from 1768 to 2008."
Niger,Niamey,NER,Africa,"Niamey, city, capital of Niger. Located along the Niger River in the southwest corner of the republic, it originated as an agricultural village of Maouri, Zarma (Zerma, Djerma), and Fulani people. It was established as the capital of Niger colony in 1926, and after World War II it grew rapidly. Today Niamey is occupied by Yoruba and Hausa traders, merchants, officials, and craftsmen from Nigeria, Benin, and Togo as well as from other parts of Niger. The city, which lies mainly on the left (north) bank of the river, has expanded onto the right bank since the construction of the Kennedy Bridge in 1970."
North Korea,Pyongyang,PRK,Asia,"P’yŏngyang, province-level municipality and capital of North Korea. It is located in the west-central part of the country, on the Taedong River about 30 miles (48 km) inland from Korea Bay of the Yellow Sea. The city site occupies a level area on both sides of the river, and the built-up area spreads northward and eastward toward low mountains. P’yŏngyang is reputed to be the oldest city in Korea."
China,Beijing,CHN,Asia,"The city of Beijing is situated at the northern apex of the roughly triangular North China Plain and lies at an elevation between about 100 and 130 feet (30 and 40 metres) above sea level. The larger municipality is almost completely surrounded by Hebei province, except for two short stretches bordering Tianjin municipality to the southeast. The Yan Mountains lie along the municipality’s northeastern side, and the Jundu Mountains occupy its entire western region; together these form a concave arc that circles the Beijing lowland from the northeast to the southwest to form what is known to geologists as the “Bay of Beijing.”

The city was built at the mouth of this embayment, which opens onto the great plain to the south and east, and between two rivers, the Yongding and the Chaobai, which eventually join to empty into the Bo Hai (Gulf of Chihli) in Tianjin municipality, some 100 miles (160 km) southeast of Beijing. To the south of the city the plain spreads out for about 400 miles (650 km) until it merges into the lower valley and the delta of the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang). On the east the plain is bounded by the sea, except for the break caused by the Shandong Hills; on the west it is flanked by the Taihang Mountains, which constitute the eastern edge of the Loess Plateau (loess is loamy material deposited by wind)."
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Belfast,GBR,Europe,"Belfast, Irish Béal Feirste, city, district, and capital of Northern Ireland, on the River Lagan, at its entrance to Belfast Lough (inlet of the sea). It became a city by royal charter in 1888. After the passing of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, it became the seat of the government of Northern Ireland. The district of Belfast has an area of 44 square miles (115 square km). The site of Belfast was occupied during both the Stone and Bronze ages, and the remains of Iron Age forts are discernible on the slopes near the city centre. A castle, probably built there about 1177 by John de Courci, the Norman conqueror of Ulster, seems to have survived until the beginning of the 17th century. The city’s name is derived from the Gaelic Béal Feirste (Mouth of the Sandbank [or Crossing of the River]). Belfast’s modern history began in 1611 when Baron Arthur Chichester built a new castle there. He did much to encourage the growth of the town, which received a charter of incorporation in 1613. Belfast survived the Irish insurrection of 1641, and by 1685 it had a population of about 2,000, largely engaged in brick, rope, net, and sailcloth making. By the late 1730s the castle had been destroyed, but Belfast was beginning to acquire economic importance, superseding both Lisburn as the chief bridge town and Carrickfergus as a port. It became the market centre of the Ulster linen industry, developed by French Huguenot refugees under the patronage of William III of Great Britain at the end of the 17th century. Attempts to establish a cotton industry there were short-lived, but following mechanization of the spinning and weaving of linen, Belfast became one of the greatest linen centres in the world. By the 17th century, the town was a busy port with small shipbuilding interests, which became firmly established after William Ritchie founded a shipyard (1791) and a graving (dry) dock (1796). Since the Industrial Revolution, the chief shipbuilding firm has been Harland and Wolff (builders of the ill-fated Titanic). The city was severely damaged by air raids in 1941 during World War II. Beginning in the 1970s, Belfast’s traditional manufacturing specialties, linen and shipbuilding, began a long decline. These sectors are now overshadowed by service activities, food processing, and machinery manufacture."
Pakistan,Islamabad,PAK,Asia,"Islamabad, city, capital of Pakistan, on the Potwar Plateau, 9 miles (14 km) northeast of Rawalpindi, the former interim capital. The city’s site was chosen by a commission in 1959 after Karachi was found unsuitable as the capital. Construction began in 1961 with an effort to blend traditional Islamic architecture with modern patterns and requirements. Such world-renowned names in town planning and architecture as Konstantínos Doxiádes, Edward Durell Stone, and Gio Ponti have been associated with the city’s development. It is a compact city (area 25 square miles [65 square km]), lying at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,000 feet (450 to 600 metres). The second phase of construction ended with completion of the Secretariat, Pakistan House, President’s House, National Assembly Building, Grand National Mosque, and housing for government staff. The University of Islamabad was established in 1965 and the People’s Open University (later renamed the Allama Iqbal Open University) in 1974. The war with India in 1971 slowed construction temporarily."
Philippines,Manila,PHL,Asia,"Manila, capital and chief city of the Philippines. The city is the centre of the country’s economic, political, social, and cultural activity. It is located on the island of Luzon and spreads along the eastern shore of Manila Bay at the mouth of the Pasig River. The city’s name, originally Maynilad, is derived from that of the nilad plant, a flowering shrub adapted to marshy conditions, which once grew profusely along the banks of the river; the name was shortened first to Maynila and then to its present form. In 1975, by presidential decree, Manila and its contiguous cities and municipalities were integrated to function as a single administrative region, known as Metropolitan Manila (also called the National Capital Region); the Manila city proper encompasses only a small proportion of that area."
Poland,Warsaw,POL,Europe,"Warsaw, Polish Warszawa, city, capital of Poland. Located in the east-central part of the country, Warsaw is also the capital of Mazowieckie województwo (province). Warsaw is notable among Europe’s capital cities not for its size, its age, or its beauty but for its indestructibility. It is a phoenix that has risen repeatedly from the ashes of war. Having suffered fearful damage during the Swedish and Prussian occupation of 1655–56, it was again assaulted in 1794, when the Russian army massacred the population of the right-bank suburb of Praga. In 1944, after the Warsaw Uprising failed, by Adolf Hitler’s order the city was razed; the left-bank suburbs, controlled by the Germans, were emptied of their remaining population; and the buildings were systematically reduced to rubble by fire and dynamite. In 1945, however, the people of Warsaw, the Varsovians, returned, and the city resumed its role as the capital of Poland and the country’s centre of social, political, economic, scientific, and cultural life. Many of the historical streets, buildings, and churches have been restored exactly according to their original forms."
Portugal,Lisbon,PRT,Europe,"Lisbon, Portuguese Lisboa, city, port, capital of Portugal, and the centre of the Lisbon metropolitan area. Located in western Portugal on the estuary of the Tagus (Tejo) River, it is the westernmost capital city in continental Europe and serves as the country’s chief port, largest city, and commercial, political, and tourist centre. The city’s name is a modification of the ancient Olisipo (Ulyssipo), and its founding has been attributed to the legacy of Ulysses (Odysseus), the hero of Homer’s Odyssey; to Elisha, purported to have been a grandson of the Hebrew patriarch Abraham; and, more credibly, to Phoenician colonists. Lisbon owes its historical prominence to its natural harbour, one of the most beautiful in the world."
Serbia,Belgrade,SRB,Europe,"Belgrade, Serbo-Croatian Beograd (“White Fortress”), city, capital of Serbia. It lies at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers in the north-central part of the country. Belgrade is located at the convergence of three historically important routes of travel between Europe and the Balkans: an east-west route along the Danube River valley from Vienna to the Black Sea; another that runs westward along the valley of the Sava River toward Trieste and northern Italy; and a third running southeast along the valleys of the Morava and Vardar rivers to the Aegean Sea. To the north and west of Belgrade lies the Pannonian Basin, which includes the great grain-growing region of Vojvodina."
Singapore,Singapore,SGP,Asia,"Singapore, city, capital of the Republic of Singapore. It occupies the southern part of Singapore Island. Its strategic position on the strait between the Indian Ocean and South China Sea, complemented by its deepwater harbour, has made it the largest port in Southeast Asia and one of the world’s greatest commercial centres. The city, once a distinct entity, so came to dominate the island that the Republic of Singapore essentially became a city-state. Singapore—known variously as the “Lion City” or “Garden City,” the latter for its many parks and tree-lined streets—has also been called “instant Asia” because it offers the tourist an expeditious glimpse into the cultures brought to it by immigrants from all parts of Asia. While predominantly Chinese, it has substantial minorities of Malays and Indians."
Slovakia,Bratislava,SVK,Europe,"Bratislava, German Pressburg, Hungarian Pozsony, city, capital of Slovakia. It lies in the extreme southwestern part of the country, along the Danube where that river has cut a gorge in the Little Carpathian Mountains near the meeting point of the frontiers of Slovakia, Austria, and Hungary. Vienna is 35 miles (56 km) west. Archaeological evidence suggests prehistoric habitation of the site, which was later fortified and settled by the Celts and Romans and finally in the 8th century was inhabited by the Slavs. The community developed as a trade centre and was granted the rights of a free royal town in 1291. The first university in what was then Hungary, the Istropolitana Academy, was founded there in 1465. Bratislava served as the Hungarian capital from 1526 until 1784, when most of the middle Danube basin was in the hands of the Turks, and the Hungarian parliament continued to meet there until 1848. The Habsburg rulers were crowned kings of Hungary in the city’s Gothic Cathedral of St. Martin."
Slovenia,Ljubljana,SVN,Europe,"Ljubljana, German Laibach, Italian Lubiana, capital city and economic, political, and cultural centre of Slovenia, located on the Ljubljanica River. The city lies in central Slovenia in a natural depression surrounded by high peaks of the Julian Alps. A walled Roman encampment was built there in the mid-1st century BCE by Roman legionnaires and developed into the settlement of Emona (Iulia Aemona), though the area had been settled earlier by the Veneti, the Illyrians, and the Celts, beginning about 1000 BCE. Sitting on the route to Pannonia and commanding the Ljubljana Gap, the strategically located city was destroyed by Attila in the mid-5th century. The Slovene Slavic tribes, migrating westward, rebuilt it in the 12th century, when its name was recorded first as Laibach (1144) and then as Luvigana (1146). It gained city rights in 1220."
South Korea,Seoul,KOR,Asia,"Seoul, Korean Sŏul, formally Sŏul-t’ŭkpyŏlsi (“Special City of Seoul”), city and capital of South Korea (the Republic of Korea). It is located on the Han River (Han-gang) in the northwestern part of the country, with the city centre some 37 miles (60 km) inland from the Yellow Sea (west). Seoul is the cultural, economic, and political centre of South Korea. Except for a brief interregnum (1399–1405), Seoul was the capital of Korea from 1394 until the formal division of the country in 1948. The name itself has come to mean “capital” in the Korean language. The city was popularly called Seoul in Korean during both the Chosŏn (Yi) dynasty (1392–1910) and the period of Japanese rule (1910–45), although the official names in those periods were Hansŏng (Hanseong) and Kyŏngsŏng (Gyeongseong), respectively. The city was also popularly and, during most of the 14th century, officially known as Hanyang. Seoul became the official name of the city only with the founding of South Korea in 1948."
Spain,Madrid,ESP,Europe,"Madrid, city, capital of Spain and of Madrid provincia (province). Spain’s arts and financial centre, the city proper and province form a comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) in central Spain. Madrid’s status as the national capital reflects the centralizing policy of the 16th-century Spanish king Philip II and his successors. The choice of Madrid, however, was also the result of the city’s previous obscurity and neutrality: it was chosen because it lacked ties with an established nonroyal power rather than because of any strategic, geographic, or economic considerations. Indeed, Madrid is deficient in other characteristics that might qualify it for a leading role. It does not lie on a major river, as so many European cities do; the 16th–17th-century dramatist Lope de Vega, referring to a magnificent bridge over the distinctly unimposing waters of the Manzanares, suggested either selling the bridge or buying another river. Madrid does not possess mineral deposits or other natural wealth, nor was it ever a destination of pilgrimages, although its patron saint, San Isidro, enjoys the all-but-unique distinction of having been married to another saint. Even the city’s origins seem inappropriate for a national capital: its earliest historical role was as the site of a small Moorish fortress on a rocky outcrop—part of the northern defenses of what was then the far more important city of Toledo, located about 43 miles (70 km) south-southwest."
Sweden,Stockholm,SWE,Europe,"Stockholm, capital and largest city of Sweden. Stockholm is located at the junction of Lake Mälar (Mälaren) and Salt Bay (Saltsjön), an arm of the Baltic Sea, opposite the Gulf of Finland. The city is built upon numerous islands as well as the mainland of Uppland and Södermanland. By virtue of its location, Stockholm is regarded as one of the most beautiful capital cities in the world. Stockholm was first mentioned as a town in 1252 and was largely built by the Swedish ruler Birger Jarl. It grew rapidly as a result of a trade agreement made with the German city of Lübeck. This agreement ensured Lübeck merchants freedom from customs charges for their trade in Sweden, as well as the right to settle there. The city came to be officially regarded as the Swedish capital in 1436. After conflicts between the Danes and Swedes for many years, Stockholm was liberated from Danish rule by Gustav I Vasa in 1523."
Switzerland,Bern,CHE,Europe,"Bern, also spelled Berne, city, capital of Switzerland and of Bern canton, in the west-central part of the country. It lies along a narrow loop of the Aare River. The existence of the ancient castle of Nydegg, guarding a crossing over the Aare, probably led Berthold V, duke of Zähringen, to found Bern in 1191 as a military post on the frontier between the German-speaking Alemanni and the French-speaking inhabitants of Burgundy. After the extinction of the Zähringen dynasty (1218), Bern became a free imperial city. Gradually it extended its power by acquiring surrounding territory, becoming an independent state that in 1353 entered the Swiss Confederation, which it soon began to lead. After a devastating fire ravaged the predominantly wood-built town in 1405, Bern was rebuilt with sandstone. Although much of the surrounding metropolis has since been modernized, the centre (Old Bern) still remains intact from that period. Bern was the scene of a disputation in 1528 between Roman Catholics and Reformers that led to its acceptance and subsequent championship of Protestant doctrines. In the 18th century Bern governed 52 territories, and its patricians exercised considerable power. The whole system of Bernese patrician government was swept away by the French in 1798; it was partially revived in 1815 but ended in 1831. Bern became the political capital of the Swiss Confederation in 1848."
